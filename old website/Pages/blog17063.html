			  <p align="justify">This is what exactly an NGO can do to our society, to our nation, to the world. In spite of the major contributions done, we believe there is always a room for improvement. In India, we have a numbers of NGOs working for the social cause, but still, we need more invisible hands to act upon.</p>
			 <p align="justify">First of all, let us work upon the statement – ‘How can an NGO be a part in making a better society? It is requisite to catch out the root cause for the society leading it towards its sluggishness. All the problems are interconnected to one another.</p>

According to <strong>GLOBAL WEALTH REPORT 2016 </strong>compiled  by Credit Suisse Research Institute, India is the 2nd most unequal  country in the world with the top 1% of the population owning nearly 60% of the  total wealth.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Causes of vicious cycle of poverty- low productivity,  low salary, poor infrastructure and governance, business failure, ignorance,  lack of skills and technology, unhealthiness, no ongoing education,  unemployment.</p>

                  <p align="justify" class="donate"><strong>PROBLEMS PERSEVERING FOR  UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE</strong></p>
                  <p align="justify">In the book- JEOPARDY: Can We Break the Cycle of  Poverty, IRVING B. HARRIS discusses  ways in which children can be helped to begin breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
                  <p align="justify">India is home to over 30% of almost 385 million  children living in extreme poverty, the highest in south Asia, according to a  new report by WORLD BANK GROUP and UNICEF, ending poverty.</p>
                 <p align="center"><img src="images/blog_images/blog17063/2.jpg" width="1187" height="578" alt="image2">Image Source:  hotfrog.in</p>
                  <p align="justify">People get their girls married at very early age  which hamper their studies</p>
                  <p align="justify">NGO can help in discouraging teenage pregnancy and  finding ways to decrease this so that when children are born (especially girls),  they can have a better chance at breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Fewer low-income children have access to quality  early childhood education, so they enter kindergarten lacking basic skills such  as letter recognition and counting skills.</p>
                  <p align="justify">NGO can center on basic skills especially in  rural areas prior to their prep education. Study after study shows that low-income children enter school having heard 30 million fewer words spoken than their middle-class peers. A limited vocabulary makes it difficult to learn to read when children have never been exposed to the words. NGOs can foster the growth in underrated areas  by appointing better qualified staffs in schools.</p>
                <p align="justify">Children from low-income families may not  consult the doctor often. So vision problems, dental problems and mental health  issues do not get addressed as quickly and make it harder for children to learn.</p>
                  <p align="justify">NGO can contribute through the provision of free  routine health checkups, and even promote cleanliness drives so as to prevent  reoccurring health problems.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Many children from poor backgrounds have the additional problem that they and their parents are not fluent in English, which is now considered as a global language.</strong></p>
                  <p align="justify" class="donate">More English speaking courses should be emphasized  to make them able to compete and survive in this fast moving world.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Children from low-income family often do not get  enrichment opportunities their peers have such as music, dance, art or sports  lessons and trips to museums, historical site and other places.</p>
                  <p align="justify">This is really an important issue neglected for  a long haul. NGO can provide positive instincts for the talents cast aside.</p>
                  <p align="justify">INDISSOLUBLE ILLITERACY</p>
                  <p align="justify"><u>Global Monitoring Report (GMR)</u> released worldwide by the UNESCO acknowledges the headway made by India in improving access to education but the country’s population of illiterate adults has been identified as the drag factor.</p>
                   <p align="justify">India currently has the largest population of  illiterate adults in the world, 287 million. This is 37% of global total. While  India&rsquo;s literacy rate rose from 48% in 1991 to 63% in 2006, population growth  cancelled the gains so there was no change in the number of illiterate adults.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Girl  education is still an evolving issue especially in backward areas. Data from a  forthcoming paper suggest that in 24 low-income countries, only 34% girls in  the poorest 20% of households complete primary school, compared with 72% of  girls in the richest 20% of households. These income-related gaps can be  reduced through intervention to reduce the cost of schooling for girls, such as <u>conditional cash transfers</u></p>

                  <p align="justify">Girl education can be promoted through more <u>anganvadi </u>centers after marriage  education</p>
              <p align="justify">Providing financial assistance for education to  poorer section of society is also an effective means.</p>
               <p align="justify">Like a popular saying</p>
                <p align="justify">You educate a man</p>
                <p align="justify">You educate a man</p>
              <p align="justify">You educate a woman</p>
               <p align="justify">You  educate a generation</p>
                  <p align="justify"><u>A  NEW CONCEPT CAN BE USEFUL IN THIS REGARD. NGO CAN START JOB-ORIENTED FEESTRUCTURE SCHOOLING</u>, which provides free of  cost education and charging fee similarly, (like 10% of the salary earned by the concerned students in future), which would be agreement based.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Door to door educational promotion events in  overlooked areas should be enforced, because in some areas, illiteracy may persist  till generations to come because of illiterate family backgrounds.</p>
                  <p align="justify">These are the measures that an NGO can undertake  to make a better citizen for better society.</p>
