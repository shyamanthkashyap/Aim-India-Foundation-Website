			  <p align="justify">Across  the world malnutrition is a grave threat to maternal and child health. Most of  the victims are in the developing nations. A balanced nutritious diet is  required for proper functioning of the body. Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)  and growth retardation are probably the most widespread health and nutritional  problems of the developing countries including India followed by micro-nutrient  deficiency.</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/blog_images/blog16092/1.jpg" width="1187" height="978" alt="image1">Image source: dailytimes.com.pk</p>
			  <p align="justify">India has a higher level of PEM  than most parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa. Over 75% of  pre-school children suffer from iron deficiency anaemia, and 57% have  subclinical Vitamin A deficiency. Deficiency of essential micronutrients such  as vitamin A, iron, iodine, folic acid and zinc, constitutes a major health  threat for a large number of children in India. Estimates suggest that every  day, more than 6,000 under-fives die in India and more than half of these  deaths are caused by malnutrition, mainly due to micronutrient deficiency.  About 57 percent of preschoolers and their mothers have sub-clinical vitamin A  deficiency. 26% of the country&rsquo;s population is zinc deficient which contributes  directly to stunting. Nearly 50,000 children are deformed every year due to  folic acid deficiency. Iodine deficiency is endemic in India. The  prevalence of different micronutrient deficiencies varies widely across states.  India has 48% stunted, 20% wasted and 43% underweight children below 5 years of  age. Poor nutrition contributes to about 5.6 million child deaths per year and  more than half of the total deaths take place in India. A more serious concern  is the fact that the number of children under-five who are underweight has  remained almost unchanged since 1990 (UNICEF, 2006). The statistic - which means 3,000 children  dying daily due to illnesses related to poor diets.</p>
			  <p align="justify">The prevalence of severe  malnutrition among children in the 0-6 age group has emerged as one of the  grave issues of child health in India while West Bengal is no exception. &lsquo;Kwashiorkor&rsquo;  and &lsquo;Marasmus&rsquo; are the dangerous outcomes of PEM briefly conceived as  malnutrition. The word &ldquo;Kwashiorkor&rdquo; was suggested by Dr. Cicely Williams in  the early 1930s. It is an African word which means &ldquo;the disease that occurs  when the child is displaced from the breast by another child&rdquo;. &ldquo;Marasmus&rdquo; can  develop in the initial months of life and results if the mother&rsquo;s milk supply  is insufficient as a result of which the mother feed the baby with diluted milk  of buffalo and cow. Hence the common age of occurrence is 0-2 years though can  also occur at later age as well</p>
			 <p align="justify">Poverty, low birth weight,  improper birth spacing, lack of inadequate nutritious diet coupled with low  level of parental awareness and poor breast-feeding practices have contributed  to prominent appearance of child malnutrition in the state.</p>
          <p align="justify">Paediatric Tuberculosis is the  dangerous outcome of severe malnutrition. Malnutrition during pregnancy often  results into incidences of still birth, premature delivery and other  complications during post-partum period.</p>
          <p align="justify">East India emerged as the region where the state of  feminine hygiene is significantly poorer. Amongst women who use cloth, over 70%  in East said they feel insecure during periods and wished they knew more on the  subject,&rsquo; said Bhagyashri Dengle, Executive Director, Plan India.</p>
          <p>CAUSES OF MALNUTRITION</p>
		  <p align="justify" class="donate">Malnutrition has been known to be  a major health and nutrition problem in India with a high prevalence among the  pre-school children. It accounts for 46% of infant mortality. The causes of  malnutrition can be briefly stated below:</p>
		  <table width="880" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
		    <tr>
		      <td width="17%">Poverty</td>
		      <td width="83%">Low-income earner hardly can  afford to procure required quality and quantity of food to meet their  nutritional requirements. This deprivation adversely affects their capacity for  physical work resulting in low earning and poverty. Malnutrition is thus  related to the vicious cycle of poverty.</td>
	        </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Early  pregnancy</td>
		      <td>Early teenage pregnancies are  dangerous not only for the health of the mother but also for the baby. Chances  of maternal and infant mortality and complications at the time of pregnancy are  high when a girl conceives before her body attains physical maturity.</td>
	        </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Low  birth weight</td>
		      <td>Malnourishment  during pregnancy results high incidences of low weight (&lt;2.5  kg) during birth. Such infants are vulnerable to face growth retardation due to poor body nutritional reserve.  The mothers may also show poor lactation performance. </td>
	        </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Infection  and diseases</td>
		      <td>Diseases such as diarrhoea,  pneumonia, measles, malaria and tuberculosis precipitate into acute  malnutrition and aggravate the existing nutritional deficit.</td>
	        </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Poor  breast-feeding practices</td>
		      <td>A child becomes susceptible to  malnutrition in absence of breast-feeding. Artificial feeding often proves to  be disastrous for the baby due to the poor quality of the substitute milk,  excessive dilution and use of unhygienic feeding bottles and nipples.</td>
	        </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Other  causes</td>
		      <td>Repeated pregnancies, improper  birth spacing, social taboos and separation of a child from parents often  results into malnutrition among children.</td>
	        </tr>
		    </table>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Malnutrition  increases the susceptibility and severity of infections among children. A  number of other factors such as environmental, agricultural, and cultural including  various other factors contributes to malnutrition. The loss on account of  micronutrient deficiencies costs the nation 1% of GDP which amounts to Rs.  277.2 billion or more in terms of loss of productivity, illness, increased  health care costs and death (Micronutrient Initiative, 2006). Therefore  it is widely recognized that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary to tackle  the problem of malnutrition.</p>
          <p align="justify" class="donate">Crib and cot deaths coupled with  malnutrition is particularly high in districts of Maldah, Murshidabad, Uttar  Dinajpur and South 24 Parganas. Other districts enlisted as having high  proportion of malnourished children include Bankura, Barddhaman, Purba  Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur. The rural areas of these districts are  characterized by poverty, illiteracy, ignorance and negligence. </p>
          <p align="justify" class="donate">The condition of maternal and  child health has been in a tragic state in West Bengal with some initiatives  taken by the State Government in recent years. The activities of ICDS in this  respect have been praiseworthy. The Anganwadi schools meant for the children of  low socio-economic background has been running successfully in various  municipal wards of Kolkata. The health workers have been visiting households to  distribute iron tablets among pregnant women. The children in the Anganwadi  schools are given nutritious food like khichdi, vegetables, boiled egg and  pulses. They are also provided with medicine in case of severe malnourishment  and taken to doctors for height and weight check-up at regular interval. The  Government run health centers in the city conduct institutional deliveries,  ante-natal check up and post-natal check up for mothers. Inspite of such  initiatives worth mentioning, the coverage has not been satisfactory in various  wards of the city. The pregnant women and lactating mothers of the vulnerable groups  in some areas are not aware of Government initiatives and consequently they  remain deprived of the benefits of the welfare programmes. Distribution of rice  and wheat at very negligible price among the below poverty line (BPL) people through  public distribution system has increased the food intake quantity among the  mother. Kanyasri (Scholarship for teaching the girl students) reduced the rate  of early marriage.  Still we have to  miles to go.</p>
